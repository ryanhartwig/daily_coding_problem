Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x2 + y2 = r2.


Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle
